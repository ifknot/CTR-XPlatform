     * 128-bit block size.
     * Until the announcement of NIST's AES contest, the majority of block ciphers followed the example of the DES in using a block size of 64 bits (8 bytes).
     * However, the birthday paradox tells us that after accumulating a number of blocks equal to the square root of the total number possible,
     * there will be an approximately 50% chance of two or more being the same, which would start to leak information about the message contents.
     * Consequently, AES candidates were required to support a block length of 128 bits (16 bytes).
     * This should be acceptable for up to 2^64 Ã— 16 B = 256 exabytes of data - which should suffice for quite a few years to come.
     * The winner of the AES contest, Rijstddef.h>ndael, supports block and key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, but in AES the block size is always 128 bits.
